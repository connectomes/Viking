This is a fork of 
https://github.com/Fodsuk/EntityFrameworkExtras

I don't want to fork it.  I'd rather use the nuget package. 
However Viking needs to collect multiple result sets from 
stored procedure calls.  I pushed a fix to the repository in 
2016 and haven't seen it picked up.  Once multiple result sets
are accepted stop using this fork.
