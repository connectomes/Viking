//The convention for annotation textures is that they built from two 8-bit images, one image is loaded to the RGB coordinates of the texture.
//The other image is loaded into the alpha channel.
//The verticies contain an RGB color which is converted to HSL space. 

//The alpha channel of the texture indicates whether the pixel is part of the annotation or not.  The alpha value is only used for this purpose
//The RGB component of the texture indicates the saturation value of the pixel.
//The program determines Saturation via converting the RGB color attribute of the vertex.
//The program determines the hue via converting the RGB color attribute of the vertex.
//The alpha channel of vertex color indicates how much the texture value is blended with the background value.
